## DSD-NIX-0.1: A Foundation for Open-Source Exploration (FreeBSD 14.0 Base)

**diam Systems** is excited to unveil DSD-NIX-0.1, our initial foray into the open-source operating system kernel landscape. This release serves as a foundational element for ongoing experimentation and collaboration within the open-source community.

**DSD-NIX-0.1 is an unmodified version of FreeBSD 14.0.** This provides a stable and well-established base for further development. As the project progresses, DSD-NIX will evolve to incorporate innovative features and functionalities, leveraging the power of open-source collaboration.

### Key Features of FreeBSD 14.0 (Incorporated in DSD-NIX-0.1)

* **Advanced Networking:** FreeBSD boasts a robust networking stack with support for a wide range of protocols and features, including IPv4, IPv6, firewalls, routing, and more.
* **Security Focus:** Security is paramount in FreeBSD, with features like Mandatory Access Control (MAC), strong authentication mechanisms, and regular security updates.
* **Performance and Scalability:** FreeBSD is known for its efficient memory management and overall performance, making it suitable for a variety of workloads, from desktops to servers.
* **Extensive Hardware Support:** FreeBSD supports a broad range of hardware architectures, enhancing its compatibility with diverse systems.
* **Open-Source Ecosystem:** As an open-source project, FreeBSD offers a vast collection of third-party applications and ports, expanding its functionality.

### Getting Started with DSD-NIX-0.1

For detailed build instructions, please refer to the official FreeBSD documentation: [https://docs.freebsd.org/en/](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/).

Building DSD-NIX-0.1 from source requires a system running a compatible FreeBSD or Linux distribution. 

**Disclaimer:**

Modifying your kernel can potentially affect your system's stability. It's recommended to proceed with caution and have a backup plan in case of any issues.
